Anonymous submission for ICRA 2025.

This is the project page for "SurgMASt3R-SLAM: Real-Time 3D Reconstruction for Surgical Scenes via LoRA-Fine-Tuned Vision Transformers".

This page is built using the Academic Project Page Template.

## Project Overview

SurgMASt3R-SLAM presents a novel pipeline for real-time 3D reconstruction of surgical scenes, leveraging Vision Transformer-based MASt3R model fine-tuned with Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) on medical datasets.

## Features

- Real-time 3D reconstruction for surgical scenes
- Vision Transformer-based approach with LoRA fine-tuning
- Global consistency for complex medical environments
- Evaluation on SimCol3D, C3VD, and SCARED datasets
